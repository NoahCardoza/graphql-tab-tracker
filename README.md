# GraphQL Tab Tracker
This is a clone of my original [Tab Tracker project](https://github.com/NoahCardoza/tab-tracker).

It incorporates my recently acquired knowledge regarding GraphQL along with a small (GraphQL Query Constructor)[https://github.com/NoahCardoza/graphQL-queryc-constructor] which I also wrote specifically for this project, although its applications are much greater than this.

# Setup
You must at least have **NODE version 8.2.1**

### Client
```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### Server
```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
